Professor Dr. Mark Jack Feedback:

Your team outlines the business problem at hand and you provide a few example statistics on the crime rating for the city of Los Angeles to create some context.
You highlight your possible use case(s) with a blue star at the end of Slide 1.
You nicely highlight some possible success criteria on Slide 3. You separate business desires and two important risks. 
I like the selective and strategic use of color on this slide.
Suggestions:
Adding 1 or 2 statistics on Slide 1 on the impact of how crime is disrupting business in Los Angeles (e.g. economic shortfalls for the city or in specific regions or for specific groups 
or for your business in particular) could help paint the picture to the audience of how impactful the issue of crime is on starting a business in Los Angeles or any section of it. 
The audience will start rooting for you to solve the problem for your business.
I would maybe switch the order of slides 2 and 3 so you can emphasize towards the end what aspects you want to prioritize in your analysis which would inform the choice of your data science use cases. 
Adding a conclusion or summary from the three bullet points on Slide 2 would help distilling the key use cases one could work on from this data and for this business problem. 
These use cases could in your problem could be determining locations, time of day and/or day of week for optimal business operations at a lower crime rate. 
Slide 2 with its visual is missing that summary that ties it altogether. 
As mentioned I would place it at the end. Again, a visualization should be used as strategically as possible to drive your message(s).
Based on the Week 3 presentation rubric I would rate the presentation at 'proficient'.
