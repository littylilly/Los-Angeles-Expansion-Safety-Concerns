Professor Dr. Mark Jack Feedback:

Very nicely done 1-slide pitch with your team's own style.
Presentation itself was done very well in the form of a 'sales pitch'.
Overall goal, customer pain points, personas, impact and approach /methodology all addressed.
Good use of three primary colors on this slide creates a slight feel of your unique brand and does not distract. Good highlighting of two key success metrics under 'Expected Impact'.
Missing: What is your deliverable/product to the customer? What is the action requested from the stakeholders?
Presentation is evaluated as between Proficient and Exceptional categories.

Overall Grade:
18 / 20 - 90 %
