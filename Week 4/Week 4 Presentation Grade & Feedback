Professor Dr. Mark Jack Feedback:

Very nice visuals used throughout the 3 slides that help communicate the message. Maybe a bit busy to be able to follow as audience for Slides 1 and 2. 
Nicely structured on Slides 1 and 3. Good, selective use of two primary colors blue and red.
The visual on Slide 1 is nice to discern the differences in increases and decreases of specific crime rates and you provide a reference which is great.
You articulate your approach/objective and list the key advantages you expect to gain on Slide 1.
The visualization on Slide 2 is very advanced and looks very cool. The danger is you might lose parts of the audience here. Suggestion: Add a textbox around one particular area or timeframe you want to focus on in the discussion as an example of the type of information you could draw from this chart.
Slide 3 you could show earlier. it connects with the business problem and opportunities well but you could flesh out the different possible data science use cases you can derive from the data a bit more clearly.
Overall I would rate the presentation between Exceptional and Proficient.
