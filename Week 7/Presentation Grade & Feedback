Professor Dr. Mark Jack Feedback:

An excellent presentation.
You motivate the larger context of the importance of this business problem with a number of good statistics for the Los Angeles area.
The objectives, risks and implications for the stakeholders are described concisely. You describe your approach focusing on geography, time of day operations and crime types to select the three best areas to setup a business in the LA area.
You show the statistics of the three selected areas with that slight glitch in the pie chart visual your team explained after the presentation.
The crime-time area clock is a cool unique way to illustrate the time aspect and the geographic dependence of the crime rates.
You do your pitch with a contingency (alternative areas) and even illustrate a snapshot (or mock-up) of a future dashboard as your deliverable.
Overall an Exceptional presentation with just that minor glitch with the pie chart.
