Professor Dr. Mark Jack Feedback:

Great visuals. Compact presentation. Story is clear: you highlight information available on the three selected neighborhoods and use crime statistics in the data to prioritize.
To save space and time I would move Slide 7 to the Appendix. It does not add much additional information in addition to the heatmap on Slide 8. And heatmap focuses the message better.
In both cases remove the time interval after 2023 (cut off all the new data of 2024 that is incomplete). 
Overall, I would rate the presentation between Exceptional and Proficient.

Week 6 Presentation Grade:
19 / 20 - 95 %
